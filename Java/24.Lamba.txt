Lambda Expressions in Java
Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8 and are a way to provide inline implementation of functional interfaces (interfaces with a single abstract method).

They help you write concise, readable, and functional-style code, especially when working with collections, streams, and event listeners.

Syntax of Lambda Expression
(parameters) -> expression
	or
(parameters) -> { statements }

Example:
	(int a, int b) -> a + b

1.Example with Functional Interface

@FunctionalInterface
interface MathOperation {
    int operate(int a, int b);
}

public class LambdaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Lambda expression to implement the operate method
        MathOperation add = (a, b) -> a + b;
        MathOperation mul = (a, b) -> a * b;

        System.out.println("Addition: " + add.operate(10, 5));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + mul.operate(10, 5));
    }
}

2.Usage with Collections

List<String> list = Arrays.asList("Apple", "Banana", "Mango", "Grapes");
list.forEach(fruit -> System.out.println(fruit));  // Lambda in forEach


3.With Streams API
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

numbers.stream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .forEach(n -> System.out.println("Even: " + n));


Benefits of Lambda in Java
--->Reduces boilerplate code
--->Improves readability
--->Enables functional programming
--->Works well with Streams API and Collections
--->Encourages the use of functional interfaces (Runnable, Callable, Comparator, etc.)
