Java Break Statement:

The `break` statement in Java is a powerful tool for controlling the flow of your program. It is used to exit a loop or switch statement prematurely. It allows us to customize the behavior of code based on specific conditions.

When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

The Java break statement is used to break loop or switch statement. It breaks the current flow of the program at specified condition. In case of inner loop, it breaks only inner loop.


Java Break Statement with Loop

Example:
 
public class BreakExample {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
     
    for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){  
        if(i==5){  
            //breaking the loop
            break;  
        }  
        System.out.println(i);  
    }  
}  
} 
 
Output :
1
2
3
4

Java Break Statement with Inner Loop

It breaks inner loop only if you use break statement inside the inner loop.

Example:

public class BreakWithInnerLoop {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
            //outer loop   
            for(int i=1;i<=3;i++){    
                    //inner loop  
                    for(int j=1;j<=3;j++){    
                        if(i==2&&j==2){    
                            //using break statement inside the inner loop  
                            break;    
                        }    
                        System.out.println(i+" "+j);    
                    }    
            }    
}  
}  
Output:

1 1
1 2
1 3
2 1
3 1
3 2
3 3


Java Continue Statement
The continue statement is used in loop control structure when you need to jump to the next iteration of the loop immediately. It can be used with for loop or while loop.

The Java continue statement is used to continue the loop. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified condition. In case of an inner loop, it continues the inner loop only.

We can use Java continue statement in all types of loops such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop.

Example:

public class ContinueExample {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    //for loop  
    for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){  
        if(i==5){  
            //using continue statement
            continue;//it will skip the rest statement  
        }  
        System.out.println(i);  
    }  
}  
}  

output:
1
2
3
4
6
7
8
9
10
