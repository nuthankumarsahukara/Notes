how to write java program  ?

java program can be written in 2 ways

1.write the program in any text editor(notepad,notepad++,edit window,sublime,visual studio code,code blocks)

->compile and execute in the command prompt

2.write ,compile and execute in any java enabled IDE.(Integrated Development Environment)

Eg:Eclipse,NetBeans Etc...


notes for writting a program in java ?

1. one program can have only one main method .

2. all the executable statements should be terminated with semicolon

3. extension of java program should be save with .java

4. main classname and filename should be the same

5. no program can be written without class .(because java is purely oop's)

6.Without main method we can't run the java program.


java program structure 

[package specification;] (A Java package is a set of classes, interfaces, and sub-packages that are similar).
[import specification;] (importing the files/package to current class)

accessspecifier class classname
{
	public static void main(String object[])
	{
		logic here;
	}
	or
	static public void main(String object[])
	{
		logic here;
	}
	or
	static public void main(String []object)
	{
		logic here;
	}
	or
	static public void main(String ...object)
	{
		logic here;
	}
}


scope		:it defines the area where the variable/method/class is accessible

accessspecifier	: it defines the scope of variable,method or class.

java access specifiers are

private
default
protected
public

private	:private members are accessible only inside the class.so it provides data hiding
default	:default members are accessible anywhere in the same package.but it is not 		                    accessible outside the package.
protected	:protected members are accessible anywhere in the same package and outside the 		 	package only in the derived/child/sub class.
public	:public members are accessible anywhere in the program


public static void main(String object[])

public	: main method 

static	:main method is invoked without object.

void	:main method does not return any value.

main	:every program starts and ends with main

String object[]	:it is only for command line argument.it can collect any type of data in 				string format.


how to print the output ?

System.out.println	:it is used to print the output onto the monitor.

System	:it is a class of java.lang package ,java.lang is the default package in java
out	:it is an object of PrintStream class,but defined as static field in System class
println	:it is the method of PrintStream class

The execution of a Java program consists of five steps which are

-->Creation of a Java Program
-->Compiling a Java program,
-->Loading the program into the memory by Java Virtual Machine,
-->Java Virtual Machine verification for bytecode,
-->Java Program execution
