Java Scanner

Scanner class in Java is found in the java.util package. Java provides various ways to read input from the keyboard, the java.util.Scanner class is one of them.

The Java Scanner class breaks the input into tokens using a delimiter which is whitespace by default. It provides many methods to read and parse various primitive values.

The Java Scanner class is widely used to parse text for strings and primitive types using a regular expression. It is the simplest way to get input in Java. By the help of Scanner in Java, we can get input from the user in primitive types such as int, long, double, byte, float, short, etc.

The Java Scanner class extends Object class and implements Iterator and Closeable interfaces.

How to get Java Scanner:

To get the instance of Java Scanner which reads input from the user, we need to pass the input stream (System.in) in the constructor of Scanner class. 

Syntax: className objectName =new ClassName();

Eg : Scanner obj = new Scanner(System.in);  

Input Types
In the example above, we used the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings. To read other types, look at the table below:

Method		Description
nextBoolean()	Reads a boolean value from the user
nextByte()	Reads a byte value from the user
nextDouble()	Reads a double value from the user
nextFloat()	Reads a float value from the user
nextInt()		Reads a int value from the user
nextLine()		Reads a String value from the user
nextLong()	Reads a long value from the user
nextShort()	Reads a short value from the user

Example: 

import java.util.*;  
public class ScannerExample {  
public static void main(String args[]){  
          Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);  
          System.out.print("Enter your name: ");  
          String name = in.nextLine();  
          System.out.println("Name is: " + name);             
          in.close();             
          }  
}
