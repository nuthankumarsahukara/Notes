Identifiers:-

All Java variables,Method,Packages,Interface must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:


The general rules for naming variables are:

1.Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs(a-z,A-Z,0-9,_$)
2.Names must begin with a letter 
3.Names should start with a lowercase letter, and cannot contain whitespace.
4.Names can also begin with $ and _
5.Names are case-sensitive ("myVar" and "myvar" are different variables)
6.Reserved words (like Java keywords, such as int or boolean) cannot be used as names.
7.Names can't begin with digits

Eg:-      a=10; (Correct)  
	a n=10; (Wrong)
	9dgffx=10;(Wrong)
	$a=10;(correct)
	_ab=10;(correct)
	break=15;(Wrong)

Data types are divided into two groups
->Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
->Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes.

Primitive Data Types
A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:

Data        TypeSize	    Description
byte	1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	2 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 					9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean	1 bit	Stores true or false values
char	2 bytes	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values
  
Types of constants

boolean constant	(true/false)
byte constant	('a','5','%')
integer constant	(10,20,30,..)
float constant	(4.56,3.87,...)
char constant	('f','3','^',...)
string constant	("datapro",...)

escape sequence  :it is a special char in java and it perform the special operation in java.

\n	:new line
\t	:tab
\b	:backspace
\	:to ignore the meaning of special chars

Java Variables
A variable is a container which holds the value while the Java program is executed. A variable is assigned with a data type.

Variable is a name of memory location. There are three types of variables in java: local, instance and static.

There are two types of data types in Java: primitive and non-primitive.

Variable
A variable is the name of a reserved area allocated in memory. In other words, it is a name of the memory location. It is a combination of "vary + able" which means its value can be changed.

Types of Variables
There are three types of variables in Java:

local variable
instance variable
static variable

Local Variables: Defined within a method or block and accessible only there.
ex:    {
	int a=10;   ->Local Variable
	------------		
         }
Instance Variables: Defined within a class but outside any method; associated with an instance of the class.
ex:    	int a=10 ->instance Variable
 	{
	   We need create the object we can access it 
	    ------------
	}
Static Variables: Declared with the static keyword; shared among all instances of a class.
ex:	static int a =10
	{
	     -----------------
	}
how to define / declare a variable  ?

datatype variablename;

how to initialize a variable  ?

datatype variablename=value;

Eg: int x=10; char b='t';

const  : it is a keyword in c and c++. it is used to define a constant variable. the value of the constant variable can not be changed.

final  : final is the replacement of const in java.
	 
final variable: the value of the final variable can not be changed.

final int x=10;
x=20; invalid (The value of x can not be changed)

final method :final method can not be overridden.
final class	:final class can not be inherited.

java does not support operator overloading but only + operator is overloaded.

int + int = int 
int + string = string
string+ int =string
string+string=string

Example:

class OperatorOverloaded
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int ia=10,ib=20;
		float fa=15.26f,fb=12.5454f;
		double da=15354.54546,db=1515.5435;
		String sa="Nuthan",sb="Kumar";

		System.out.println("Int + int = int ("+(ia+ib)+")");
		System.out.println("Int + float = float ("+(ia+fb)+")");
		System.out.println("Int + double = double ("+(ia+da)+")");
		System.out.println("Int + String = String ("+(ia+sb)+")");
		System.out.println("float + float = float ("+(fa+fb)+")");
		System.out.println("float + int = float ("+(fa+ib)+")");
		System.out.println("float + double = double ("+(fa+ib)+")");
		System.out.println("float + String = String ("+(fa+sa)+")");
		System.out.println("double + double = double ("+(da+db)+")");
		System.out.println("double + int = double ("+(da+ib)+")");
		System.out.println("double + float = double ("+(da+fa)+")");
		System.out.println("double + String = String ("+(da+sb)+")");
		System.out.println("String + String = String ("+(sa+sb)+")");
		System.out.println("String + int = String ("+(sa+ib)+")");
		System.out.println("String + float = String ("+(sa+fb)+")");
		System.out.println("String + double = String ("+(sa+db)+")");
	}
}

output:
Int + int = int (30)
Int + float = float (22.545399)
Int + double = double (15364.54546)
Int + String = String (10Kumar)
float + float = float (27.8054)
float + int = float (35.260002)
float + double = double (35.260002)
float + String = String (15.26Nuthan)
double + double = double (16870.08896)
double + int = double (15374.54546)
double + float = double (15369.805460228881)
double + String = String (15354.54546Kumar)
String + String = String (NuthanKumar)
String + int = String (Nuthan20)
String + float = String (Nuthan12.5454)
String + double = String (Nuthan1515.5435)

Java Type Casting:-

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.

In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
byte -> short -> char -> int -> float -> long -> double

Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
double -> long -> float -> int -> char -> short -> byte

Widening Casting:

Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type:

public class WideningCasting {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int myInt = 9;
    double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

    System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
    System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0
  }
}

Narrowing Casting

Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value
Ex:
public class NarrowingCasting {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    double myDouble = 9.78d;
    int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int
    System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
    System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
  }
}


Java Operators:

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:

int x = 100 + 50;
	
int a=15;
int b=20;
int c=a+b;

Java divides the operators into the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Ternary operator
Bitwise operators
Shift operators

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.

Operator	   Name			Description	                Example	
     +	Addition		Adds together two values		x + y	
     -	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y	
     *	Multiplication	Multiplies two values		x * y	
     /	Division		Divides one value by another		x / y	
    %	Modulus		Returns the division remainder	x % y	
    ++	Increment		Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x	
     --	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

Ex: 
class Operations
{
	public static void main(String A[])
	{
		int a=50;
		int b=3;
		System.out.println("Arithmetic Operators");
		System.out.println("Addition :"+(a+b));
		System.out.println("Subtraction :"+(a-b));
		System.out.println("Multiplication :"+(a*b));
		System.out.println("Division :"+(a/b));
		System.out.println("Module :"+(a%b));
		System.out.println("Before Increment :"+a);
		a++;
		System.out.println("After Increment :"+a);
		System.out.println("Before Decrement :"+a);
		a--;
		System.out.println("After Decrement :"+a);
	}
}

Assignment operators: Assignment operators are used to assign values to a variable. The left side operand of the assignment operator is a variable, and the right side operand of the assignment operator is a value.
Ex: a=10;

Operator   Example	      Same As	
   =	  x = 5	       x = 5	
  +=	 x += 3	       x = x + 3	
  -=	 x -= 3	       x = x - 3	
  *=	 x *= 3	       x = x * 3	
  /=	 x /= 3	       x = x / 3	
  %=	 x %= 3	       x = x % 3	
  &=	 x &= 3	       x = x & 3	
   |=	 x |= 3	       x = x | 3	
   ^=	 x ^= 3	       x = x ^ 3	
  >>=	 x >>= 3           x = x >> 3	
  <<=	 x <<= 3           x = x << 3

Ex:
class AssignmentOperators
{
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int x=50;		
		System.out.println("Assignment Operators");
		System.out.println(x+"+50");
		System.out.println("Addition :"+(x+=50));
		System.out.println(x+"-5");
		System.out.println("Subtraction :"+(x-=5));
		System.out.println(x+"*10");
		System.out.println("Multiplication :"+(x*=10));
		System.out.println(x+"/2");
		System.out.println("Division :"+(x/=2));
		System.out.println(x+"%2");
		System.out.println("Module :"+(x%=2));
	}
}

Java Comparison Operators

1.Comparison operators are used to compare two values (or variables). This is important in programming, because it helps us to find answers and make decisions.

2.The return value of a comparison is either true or false. These values are known as Boolean values


==	Equal to			x == y	
!=	Not equal			x != y	
>	Greater than		x > y	
<	Less than			x < y	
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y	
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

Eg:
class ComparisonOperators
{
	public static void main(String ab[])
	{
		int a=50;
		int b=45;
		boolean c=a>b;
		boolean d=a<b;
		boolean e=a==b;
		boolean f=a>=b;
		boolean g=a<=b;
		boolean h=a!=b;
		System.out.println("Comparison Operators");
		System.out.println("The value of A :"+a+" and B :"+b);
		System.out.println("Greathan :"+c);
		System.out.println("lessthan :"+d);
		System.out.println("Equals :"+e);
		System.out.println("Greathan Equal:"+f);
		System.out.println("Lessthan Equal:"+g);
		System.out.println("Not Equals :"+h);
	}
}
