The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:

-->width and height of the viewport
-->width and height of the device
-->orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)
-->resolution

Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet (responsive web design) to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Syntax:
@media not|only mediatype and (mediafeature and|or|not mediafeature) {
  CSS-Code;
}

meaning of the not, only and and keywords:

not: The not keyword inverts the meaning of an entire media query.

only: The only keyword prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the specified styles. It has no effect on modern browsers.

and: The and keyword combines a media feature with a media type or other media features.

They are all optional. However, if you use not or only, you must also specify a media type.


Example:
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  div.example {
    display: none;
  }
}

body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 400px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}

@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
  body {
    background-color: lavender;
  }
}
