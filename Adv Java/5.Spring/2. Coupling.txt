Tight Coupling in Java occurs when a class is highly dependent on the structure or implementation of another class. This means a change in one class directly affects the other.

// Engine class
class Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine Started");
    }
}

// Car class is tightly coupled to Engine
class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // Direct instantiation

    public void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car Started");
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car = new Car();
        car.startCar();
    }
}


Why is this Tight Coupling?
The Car class creates an Engine object using new Engine().

If you want to switch to a different engine (e.g., ElectricEngine), you'll have to modify the Car class, breaking the Open/Closed Principle.

 Loose Coupling Example in Java
We achieve loose coupling by programming to an interface, not an implementation. This way, classes depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.

// Engine interface
interface Engine {
    void start();
}


// PetrolEngine class
class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Petrol Engine Started");
    }
}

// ElectricEngine class
class ElectricEngine implements Engine {
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Electric Engine Started");
    }
}


// Car class loosely coupled to Engine interface
class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    // Inject the engine through the constructor
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    public void startCar() {
        engine.start();
        System.out.println("Car Started");
    }
   public static void main(String[] args) {		 
	Car obj1 = new Car(new PetrolEngine());
	obj1.startCar();
   }
}

Benefits of Loose Coupling:

--->Flexibility: Easily switch between engine types without changing the Car class.
--->Maintainability: Easier to test and update.
--->Scalability: Add new engine types without touching existing classes.
