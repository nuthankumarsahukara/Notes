What is Spring MVC?
Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a framework within the Spring ecosystem for building web applications. It separates application logic into three interconnected components:

Model: Data and business logic
View: User interface
Controller: Handles user input and interactions

Spring MVC Architecture

Client --> DispatcherServlet --> Controller --> Service --> DAO --> DB
                          ↓
                       ViewResolver
                          ↓
                        View (JSP)
Key Components:

DispatcherServlet: Front controller that routes requests to appropriate handlers.
Controller: Handles HTTP requests (@Controller or @RestController)
Model: Stores data passed between controller and view.
ViewResolver: Resolves logical view names to actual views (e.g., JSP).
Service Layer: Business logic (annotated with @Service)
DAO Layer: Database access logic (@Repository)

 Spring MVC Annotations

@Controller: Marks a class as a Spring MVC controller.

@RequestMapping: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods.

@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping: Shortcuts for @RequestMapping.

@RequestParam: Binds query parameters to method arguments.
@PathVariable: Binds URI template variables to method arguments.
@ModelAttribute: Binds form data to model objects.
@ResponseBody: Sends data (e.g., JSON) directly in the response.
@RestController: Combines @Controller and @ResponseBody.
