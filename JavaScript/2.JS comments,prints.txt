Difference between document.write() and window.document.write()
There is no difference between the two. Remember, the window object is the highest level object. It can contain other objects and their methods. Hence, document is a object contained inside the window object; write() is a method of the document object .

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script>
window.document.write("Welcome to JavaScript")
document.write("<br>")
document.write("Good Bye...!!")
</script>
</head>

Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
The write() method writes HTML expressions or JavaScript code to a document.

Syntax
document.write(exp1,exp2,exp3,...)

Example:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script type='text/javascript'>
document.write("<h1>Hello World!</h1><p>Have a nice day!</p>");
</script>
</body>
 
Document writeln() Method
The writeln() method is identical to the write() method, with the addition of writing a new space character after each statement.

Syntax
document.writeln(exp1,exp2,exp3,...)

Example:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<pre>
<script type='text/javascript'>
document.write("Hello World!");
document.write("Have a nice day!");
</script>
</pre>
<pre>
<script type='text/javascript'>
document.writeln("Hello World!");
document.writeln("Have a nice day!");
</script>
</pre>
</body>

JavaScript Statements
A JavaScript program is a list of logical statements. In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser. JavaScript statements are composed of Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<p id="msg"></p>
<script type='text/javascript'>
document.getElementById("msg").innerHTML = "Hello Nuthan Sir.";
</script>
</body>

JavaScript Code
JavaScript code is a sequence of JavaScript statements. Each statement is executed by the browser in the sequence they are written.

This example will write a heading and paragraphs to a web page:
Example
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
document.write("<h1>This is a heading</h1>");
document.write("<p>This is a paragraph.</p>");
</script> 
</head>

JavaScript Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in blocks. Blocks start with a left curly bracket {, and end with a right curly bracket }. The purpose of a block is to make the sequence of statements execute together. 

This example will write a heading and two paragraphs to a web page:
Example
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
{
document.write("<h1>This is a heading</h1>");
document.write("<p>This is a paragraph.</p>");
document.write("<p>This is another paragraph.</p>");
}
</script>
</head>


Comments in JAVASCRIPT:
Comments are non-executable statements or ignore statements. Comments are using to declare customize statements or user defined statements within the source code.

In JavaScript comments are classified into the following types.
1. Single line comments
2. Multiline comments

1. Single line comments
These comments are applicable to a specific line or statement. It is always denoted with (//) double forward slash.

Syntax:
// This is a comment

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type='text/javascript'>
//document.write("Hello Comment");
//document.write("Thank U");
</script>
</head>

O/P: Blank Page

2. Multiline comments:
These comments are applicable one or more lines. It is always denoted with /* */ 

Syntax:
/* 
Statements
Statements
*/

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script>
/* document.write("Welcome to JS");
document.write("Thank U");
document.write("Good Bye"); */
</script>
</head>

JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

Fixed values => Fixed values are called Literals/Constants.
Variable values => Variable values are called Variables/Identifier.

JavaScript Literals
1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:
10.50; 1001

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<script>
var a=10
document.write("The Value is: "+a +"<br>")
var a=9.99
document.write("The Value is: "+a)
</script>
</body>

2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
"JavaScrpt"; 'JavaScript'

JavaScript Variables
In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. JavaScript uses the var keyword to declare variables. An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>
<script>
var x; x = 6;
document.write("The Value is: "+x +"<br>")
</script>
</body>


JavaScript and Camel Case
Programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

Underscore:
first_name, last_name, master_card, inter_city.

Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):
FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InterCity.

Lower Camel Case:
JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:
firstName, lastName, masterCard, interCity.

Semicolons are Optional:
Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character.

Example:
<!doctype html>
<script> 
var1 = 10 
var2 = 20 
</script>

Example:
<!doctype html>
<script> 
var1 = 10; var2 = 20; 
</script>

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<script>
document.write("Hello Welcome to JS");document.write("Hello Welcome to JS")
</script>
</body>

Note: It is a good programming practice to use semicolons.

JavaScript White Space
JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<script>
var Name =  "RajuSir";
var Name="RajuSir"; 
</script>
</body>

JavaScript is Case Sensitive
A function named "myfunction" is not the same as "myFunction" and a variable named "myVar" is not the same as "myvar".

Example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<script>
var a=10;A=100;b=1;B=100
document.write(a+A)
document.write("<br/>")
document.write(b-B)
</script>
</body>
