JavaScript Hoisting
JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted. Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

Example1:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script type='text/javascript'>
x = 5;
document.write("The Value is: ",x)
var x; 
</script>
</body>

Example2:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script type='text/javascript'>
var x; 
x = 5;
document.write("The Value is: ",x)
</script>
</body>

NOTE:
JavaScript Initializations are Not Hoisted. JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initializations.

EXAMPLE:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script type='text/javascript'>
var x = 5; 
var y = 7; 
document.write(x+y)
</script>
</body>

EXAMPLE:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<script type='text/javascript'>
document.write(x+y)
var x = 5; 
var y = 7; 
</script>
</body>

JavaScript Use Strict
"use strict";  Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode". The "use strict" directive is new in JavaScript 1.8.5 (ECMAScript version 5).

Declaring Strict Mode
Declared at the beginning of a JavaScript file, it has global scope (all code will execute in strict mode):

Example:
<body>
<p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>
<script>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;    // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
</script>
</body>

Why Strict Mode?
Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript. Strict mode changes previously accepted "bad syntax" into real errors.

What is a Webform?
A Webform (HTML form) allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. These forms contains checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields.  Webforms are defined in formal programming languages such as HTML, Perl, Php, Java or .NET.

JavaScript Form Validation:
HTML form validation can be done by a JavaScript.  JavaScript, provides a way to validate form's data on the client's computer before sending it to the web server. Form validation generally performs two functions.

Basic Validation - The form must be checked to make sure data was entered into each form field that required it. This would need just loop through each field in the form and check for data.

Data Format Validation - The data that is entered must be checked for correct form and value. This would need to put more logic to test correctness of data.

Data Validation
It is the process of ensuring that computer input is clean, correct, and useful.

1 The purpose of data validation is to ensure correct input to a computer application.
2 Validation can be defined by many different methods, and deployed in many different ways.
3 Server side validation is performed by a web server, after input has been sent to the server.
4 Client side validation is performed by a web browser, before input is sent to a web server.

HTML Constraint Validation
HTML5 introduced a new HTML validation concept called constraint validation.

HTML constraint validation is based on:
    Constraint validation HTML Input Attributes
    Constraint validation DOM Properties and Methods

Constraint Validation HTML Input Attributes
Attribute 	Description
disabled 	Specifies that the input element should 	be disabled
max 	Specifies the maximum value of an input 	element
min 	Specifies the minimum value of an input 	element
pattern 	Specifies the value pattern of an input element
required 	Specifies that the input field requires an element
type  	Specifies the type of an input element

Form data that typically are checked by a JavaScript:
1. If a text input is empty or not
2. If a text input is all numbers
3. If a text input is all letters (only Alphabets)
4. has the user left required fields empty?
5. has the user entered a valid e-mail address?
6. If a text input is all alphanumeric characters (numbers & letters)
7. If a text input has the correct number of characters in it 
8. If a selection has been made from an HTML select 
9. has the user entered a valid date?
10. has the user entered text in a numeric field?

Example:
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script type='text/javascript'>
function notEmpty()
{
var myTextField = document.getElementById('myText');
if(myTextField.value != "")
{
alert("You entered: " + myTextField.value)
}
else
{
alert("Would you please enter some text?")		
}
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form action='nit.html'>
<input type='text' id='myText' /><br/>
<input type='button' onclick='notEmpty()' value='Form Validate' />
</form>
</body>

Automatic HTML Form Validation
Example:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<form action="nit.html" method="post">
<input type="text" name="fname" required>
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<p>If you click submit, without filling out the text field, your browser will display an error message.</p>
</body>

The disabled Attribute
The disabled attribute specifies that the input field is disabled. A disabled element is un-usable and un-clickable. Disabled elements will not be submitted.

Example:
<!doctype html>
<body>
<form action="nit.html">
First name:<br>
<input type="text" name="firstname" value ="John" disabled><br>
Last name:<br>
<input type="text" name="lastname"><br/>
<input type='submit' value="Disabled">
</form>
</body>

Disable Button
<!doctype html>
<head>
<script>
function disableElement()
{
document.getElementById("secondbtn").disabled=true;
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
<form>
Buttons:<br/>
<input type="button" id="firstbtn" value="OK">
<input type="button" id="secondbtn" value="Cancel">
<button onclick="disableElement()">Disable button</button>
</form>
</body>
