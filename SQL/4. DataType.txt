Character data types:-
1.Character data types consist of CHAR, NCHAR, VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2, and VARCHAR.
2.The NCHAR and NVARCHAR2 data types are for storing Unicode character strings.
3.The fixed-length character data types are CHAR, NCHAR and the variable-length character data types are VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR2.
4.VARCHAR is the synonym of VARCHAR2. However, you should not use VARCHAR because Oracle may change its semantics in the future.
5.For character data types, you can specify their sizes either in bytes or characters.

Number data types:-
1.The NUMBER data type has precision p and scale s. The precision ranges from 1 to 38 while the scale range from -84 to 127.
2.If you don't specify the precision, the column can store values including fixed-point and floating-point numbers. The default value for the scale is zero.
3.The INT data type automatically creates number(38) sized field.

Datetime and Interval data types:-
1.Datetime data types are DATE, TIMESTAMP, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, and TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE. The values of a datetime data type are datetimes.
2.The interval data types are INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH and INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND. The values of interval data type are intervals.

RAW and LONG RAW data types:-
1.The RAW and LONG RAW data types are for storing binary data or byte strings e.g., the content of documents, sound files, and video files.
2.The RAW data type can store up to 2000 bytes while the LONG RAW data type can store up to 2GB.

BFILE Datatype:-
	BFILE data type stores a locator to a large binary file which locates outside the database. The locator consists of the directory and file names.

BLOB Datatype:-
	BLOB stands for binary large object. You use the BLOB data type to store binary objects with the maximum size of (4 gigabytes - 1) * (database block size).

CLOB Datatype:-
	CLOB stands for character large object. You use CLOB to store single-byte or multibyte characters with the maximum size is (4 gigabytes – 1) * (database block size).
Note that CLOB supports both fixed-with and variable-with character sets.

NCLOB Datatype:-
	NCLOB is similar to CLOB except that it can store the Unicode characters.

UROWID Datatype:-
	The UROWID is primarily for values returned by the ROWID pseudo-column. Its values are base 64 strings that represent the unique address of rows in a table.
