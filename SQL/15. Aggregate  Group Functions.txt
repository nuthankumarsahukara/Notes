Oracle Aggregate / Group Functions
Oracle Aggregate function is a type of function which operates on specified column and returns a single row result. These functions are mostly used in a query which contains GROUP BY clause in a SELECT statement where GROUP BY clause groups the rows as per specified condition and AGGREGATE function performs aggregation on the grouped data.
	•It returns a single row result based on groups of rows conditions.
	•Aggregate functions can be used in SELECT statement.
	•Aggregate functions can be used in HAVING clause as a condition.
	•It returns one result per group as an output.
	•The group of rows can be the whole table or the rows split into many groups.

Syntax of Oracle Aggregate Functions
GroupFunctionName (DISTINCT / ALL ColumnName)

Guidelines to Use:
-->DISTINCT keyword is used to ignore duplicate values and function consider only non-duplicate values.
-->ALL keyword is used to consider all values for the aggregate operation including duplicates.
-->CHAR, VARCHAR2, NUMBER or DATE data types can be used for argument.
-->All group function except COUNT(*) function ignore NULLs. The NVL function can be a better option to substitute a value for NULLS.
-->No single row column(s) should be used with group function in SELECT statement without GROUP BY clause.
