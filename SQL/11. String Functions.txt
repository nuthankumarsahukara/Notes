Functions in Oracle
A function in Oracle is a subprogram that is used to perform an action such as complex calculations and returns the result of the action as a value. There are two types of functions in Oracle. They are as follows.
1.System Defined Function / Pre-Defined Functions / Built-in Functions
2.User-Defined Function

Pre-define functions / Built-in functions in Oracle
The functions which are already defined by the oracle system and ready to be used by the user or developer are called system-defined functions or pre-defined functions. These are again classified into two categories.
1.Single row functions (scalar functions)
2.Multiple row functions (grouping functions)

Single Row Functions in Oracle: These functions are returning a single row (or) a single value.
1. Numeric/Math Functions
2. String/Char Functions
3. Date/Time Functions
4. Conversion functions
5. Analytic Functions
6. Advanced Functions
7. Miscellaneous Functions

How to call a function in Oracle?
Following is the syntax to call a function in Oracle:
SELECT <FNAME>(VALUES) FROM DUAL;

What is Dual in Oracle?
1.It is a pre-define table in oracle.
2.It is having single column & single row
3.It is called a dummy table in oracle.
4.It is used for testing functions (pre-define & user define) functionalities.

Structure of Dual table:
DESC DUAL;

Data of DUAL table:
SELECT * FROM DUAL;

String/Char Functions:-
ASCII returns the NUMBER code that represents the specified character.
Syntax ASCII( single_character)

ASCIISTR converts a string in any character set to an ASCII string using the database character set. 
Syntax ASCIISTR( string )

CHR It returns the character based on the NUMBER code.
Syntax CHR( number_code)

COMPOSE returns a Unicode string.
Syntax COMPOSE( string )
Unistring Value	Resulting character
unistr('\0300')	grave accent (`)
unistr('\0301')	acute accent (')
unistr('\0302')	circumflex (^)
unistr('\0303')	tilde (~)
unistr('\0308')	umlaut (")

CONCAT allows you to concatenate two strings together. 
Syntax: CONCAT( string1, string2)

CONVERT converts a string from one character set to another. 
Syntax:CONVERT( string1, char_set_to , [char_set_from])

Character Set	Description
US7ASCII	US 7-bit ASCII character set
WE8DEC		West European 8-bit character set
WE8HP		HP West European Laserjet 8-bit character set
F7DEC		DEC French 7-bit character set
WE8EBCDIC500	IBM West European EBCDIC Code Page 500
WE8PC850	IBM PC Code Page 850
WE8ISO8859P1	ISO 8859-1 West European 8-bit character set

DECOMPOSE accepts a string and returns a Unicode string.
Syntax DECOMPOSE( string )

DUMP returns a varchar2 value that includes the datatype code, the length in bytes, and the internal representation of the expression.
Syntax DUMP( expression [, return_format] [, start_position] [, length])

return_format
Optional. It determines the format of the return value. This parameter can be any of the following values:
Value	Explanation
8	octal notation
10	decimal notation
16	hexadecimal notation
17	single characters
1008	octal notation with the character set name
1010	decimal notation with the character set name
1016	hexadecimal notation with the character set name
1017	single characters with the character set name

INITCAP sets the first character in each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.
Syntax:INITCAP( string])

INSTR returns the location of a substring in a string.
Syntax: INSTR( string, substring [, start_position [, th_appearance ]])

LENGTH returns the length of the specified string.
Syntax: LENGTH( string1 )

LOWER converts all letters in the specified string to lowercase.
Syntax: LOWER( string1 )

LPAD pads the left-side of a string with a specific set of characters (when string1 is not null).
Syntax: LPAD( string1, padded_length [, pad_string])

LTRIM removes all specified characters from the left-hand side of a string.
Syntax: LTRIM( string] [, trim_string])

REPLACE replaces a sequence of characters in a string with another set of characters.
Syntax: REPLACE( string1, string_to_replace [, replacement_string])

RPAD pads the right-side of a string with a specific set of characters (when string1 is not null).
Syntax: RPAD( string1, padded_length [, pad_string])

RTRIM removes all specified characters from the right-hand side of a string.
Syntax: RTRIM( string] [, trim_string ] )

SOUNDEX returns a phonetic representation (the way it sounds) of a string.
Syntax: SOUNDEX( string )

Note:-
The SOUNDEX function algorithm works as follows:
1.The SOUNDEX function return value will always begin with the first letter of string1.
2.The SOUNDEX function uses only the first 5 consonants to determine the NUMERIC portion of the return value, except if the first letter of string1 is a vowel.
3.The SOUNDEX function is not case-sensitive. What this means is that both uppercase and lowercase characters will generate the same SOUNDEX function return value.

SUBSTR allows you to extract a substring from a string.
Syntax: SUBSTR( string, start_position [, length ] )

TRANSLATE replaces a sequence of characters in a string with another set of characters. However, it replaces a single character at a time.
Syntax: TRANSLATE( string1, string_to_replace, replacement_string )

TRIM removes all specified characters either from the beginning or the end of a string. 
Syntax: TRIM([[ LEADING | TRAILING | BOTH ] trim_character FROM ] string1 )

UPPER converts all letters in the specified string to uppercase.
Syntax: UPPER( string )

VSIZE returns the number of bytes in the internal representation of an expression
Syntax: VSIZE( expression)

REGEXP_INSTR
REGEXP_INSTR function is an extension of the INSTR function. It returns the location of a regular expression pattern in a string. This function, introduced in Oracle 10g, will allow you to find a substring in a string using regular expression pattern matching.
Syntax: REGEXP_INSTR( string, pattern [, start_position [, nth_appearance [, return_option [, match_parameter [, sub_expression ]]]]])

Pattern:-
The regular expression matching information. It can be a combination of the following:
Value		Description
Λ		Matches the beginning of a string. If used with a 		match_parameter of 'm', it 	matches the start of a line 		anywhere within expression.
$		Matches the end of a string. If used with a 		match_parameter of 'm', it matches the end of a line 		anywhere within expression.
*		Matches zero or more occurrences.
+		Matches one or more occurrences.
?		Matches zero or one occurrence.
.		Matches any character except NULL.
|		Used like an "OR" to specify more than one alternative.
[]		Used to specify a matching list where you are trying to 		match any one of the characters in the list.
Value		Description
[^]		Used to specify a nonmatching list where you are trying to 		match any character except for the ones in the list.
()		Used to specify a nonmatching list where you are trying to 		match
{m}		Matches m times.
{m,}		Matches at least m times.
{m,n}		Matches at least m times, but no more than n times.
\n		n is a number between 1 and 9. Matches the nth subexpression found 				within () before encountering \n.
[..]		Matches one collation element that can be more than one character.
B		Matches character classes.
|==]		Matches equivalence classes.
\d		Matches a digit character.
\D		Matches a nondigit character.
\w		Matches a word character.
\W		Matches a nonword character.
\s		Matches a whitespace character.	
\S		Matches a non-whitespace character.
\A		Matches the beginning of a string or matches at the end 		of a string before a newline character.
\Z		Matches at the end of a string.
*?		Matches the preceding pattern zero or more occurrences.
+?		Matches the preceding pattern one or more occurrences.
??		Matches the preceding pattern zero or one occurrence.
{n}?		Matches the preceding pattern n times.
(n.)?		Matches the preceding pattern at least n times.
{n.m}?		Matches the preceding pattern at least n times, but not 		more than m times.

match_parameter
Optional. It allows you to modify the matching behavior for the REGEXP_INSTR function. It can be a combination of the following:
Value		Description
'c'		Perform case-sensitive matching.
'i'		Perform case-insensitive matching.
'n'		Allows the period character (.) to match the newline 		character. By default, the period is a wildcard.
'm'		expression is assumed to have multiple lines, where A is 		the start of a line 	and $ is the end of a line, regardless 				of the position of those characters in expression. By 		default, expression is assumed to be a single line.
'X'		Whitespace characters are ignored. By default, 		whitespace characters are matched like any other 		character.

REGEXP_REPLACE
REGEXP_REPLACE function is an extension of the REPLACE function. This function, introduced in Oracle 10g, will allow you to replace a sequence of characters in a string with another set of characters using regular expression pattern matching.
Syntax: REGEXP_REPLACE( string, pattern [, replacement_string [, start_position [, nth_appearance [, match_parameter ]]]])

REGEXP_SUBSTR
REGEXP_SUBSTR function is an extension of the SUBSTR function. This function, introduced in Oracle10g, will allow you to extract a substring from a string using regular expression pattern matching.
Syntax: REGEXP_SUBSTR( string, pattern [, start_position [, nth_appearance [, match_parameter [, sub_expression ]]]])
