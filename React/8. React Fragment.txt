React Fragment 
What is a React Fragment?
A React Fragment is a special component that allows grouping multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM.

It helps avoid unnecessary <div> wrappers, keeping the HTML structure clean and optimized.

Why Use React Fragments?
1.Prevents extra <div> elements in the DOM (better performance & cleaner structure).
2. Useful when returning multiple elements from a component.
3. Helps with CSS styling and accessibility.

Basic Syntax of React Fragment
Using <React.Fragment>

import React from "react";

const Example = () => {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            <h2>Hello, React!</h2>
            <p>This is inside a Fragment.</p>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
};

export default Example;

Using Short Syntax <>...</> (Shorthand)

const Example = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <h2>Hello, React!</h2>
            <p>This is inside a Fragment.</p>
        </>
    );
};

The shorthand <>...</> is equivalent to <React.Fragment>...</React.Fragment>, but it does not support key attributes.

When to Use React Fragments?
1. When returning multiple elements from a component without adding extra <div>.
2. When rendering lists with map(), and a wrapper is required.
3. When avoiding unnecessary DOM nesting that can break styling.
