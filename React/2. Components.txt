Components are like functions that return HTML elements.

React Components
Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.

Components come in two types, Class components and Function components,we will concentrate on Function components.

Class Component
A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.

The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.

Create a Class component called Car

Example:

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

Function Component
Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function component instead.

A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand

Create a Function component called Car

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}


Components in Components
We can refer to components inside other components:

Example
Use the Car component inside the Garage component:

function Car() {
  return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
      <Car />
    </div>
  );
}
