Introduction HTTP:
It is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server. A web browser may be the client, and an application on a computer that hosts a web site may be the server.

Block Diagram of HTTP:

HTTP Request Methods:
Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: 
1 GET 
2 POST
    
Action Attribute:
This attribute is used to specify the URL of the server page to which we want to send our form data.

Syntax:
<form name="myform" action="user.aspx">

i. get:-
In this method, we dont have security for our data and only limited data can be sent to the server page. This is the default method of the form. It can carry raw data from client to server
(rawdata ==> the data which is understandable to user)

Syntax:
<form  action="page.py" method="get">

When to use GET?
Information sent from a form with the GET method is visible to everyone (all variable names and values are displayed in the URL). GET also has limits on the amount of information to send. The limitation is about 2048 characters. However, because the variables are displayed in the URL, it is possible to bookmark the page. This can be useful in some cases. GET may be used for sending non-sensitive data.

Note: GET should NEVER be used for sending passwords or other sensitive information!

Example:1
<body>
<form action="nit.html" method="get" name='myform'>
<label>User Name:</label> <br/>
<input type='text' name="user"><br/>
<label>Password:</label> <br/>
<input type="password" name="pass"><br/>
<input type="Submit" value="Sign-In">
<input type="reset" value="Cancel">
</form>
</body>

Some other notes on GET requests:
1 GET requests can be cached
2 GET requests remain in the browser history
3 GET requests can be bookmarked
4 GET requests should never be used when dealing with sensitive data
5 GET requests have length restrictions

The POST Method
In this method, we have security for our data and we can send bulk of data to the server. It can carry encrypted data from client to server page. (Encrypted means machine understandable format).

Syntax:
<form  method="post">

When to use POST?
Information sent from a form with the POST method is invisible to others (all names/values are embedded within the body of the HTTP request) and has no limits on the amount of information to send. Moreover POST supports advanced functionality such as support for multi-part binary input while uploading files to server.

Example:
<body>
<form action="nit.html" method="post" name='myform'>
<label>User Name:</label> <br/>
<input type='text' name="user"><br/>
<label>Password:</label> <br/>
<input type="password" name="pass"><br/>
<input type="Submit" value="Sign-In">
<input type="reset" value="Cancel">
</form>
</body>

1 POST requests are never cached
2 POST requests do not remain in the browser history
3 POST requests cannot be bookmarked
4 POST requests have no restrictions on data length

Difference between GETand POST:
GET				POST
Data is visible on URL address	Not visible post information
Unsecured		   	highly secured
Excellent Peformance	   	Good Performance
Transfer limited amount of data    	TransferHugeAmountOfData
Unable to Upload file	    	We can Upload files
Can be cached			Not cached
