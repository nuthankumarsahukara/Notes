Introduction to HTML:

-->HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages on the Internet.
-->It is not a programming language, but a markup language that uses tags to define content and structure.
-->HTML allows you to add text, images, links, tables, forms, videos, and other content to web pages.
-->Web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) interpret HTML code to display the web page to users.

Features of HTML:-
1.Highly flexible – Can be used to create a variety of web content.
2.User friendly – Easy to learn and use for beginners.
3.Open technology – Free to use and supported by all browsers.
4.Consistent and efficient – Works across multiple platforms and browsers.
5.Fast loading – Web pages take less time to load.

Limitations of HTML:
1.Can create only static and plain web pages.
2.Requires writing a lot of code for complex designs.
3.Security features are weak.
4.Error detection is not easy.

The Latest Version of HTML is HTML5

HISTORY of HTML :(Web-1.0)
As per W3C(world wide web consortium) standards:

-->Sir Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web (WWW).
-->He implemented the first website and developed HTML in 1989–1990 while working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research).
-->He also developed the first web browser called WorldWideWeb (later renamed Nexus).
-->His work made it possible to access, share, and link information globally through the Internet.

1989: GML(Generalized Markup Language)
1991: SGML(Standard Generalized Markup Language)
1994: HTML(HyperText Markup Language)
1998: XHTML(Extended HTML)–Combination of XML + HTML
Features: SMS, MMS, Email, Web Services

Web 2.0 and WHATWG
After 10 years (~2008)
Formation of WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group)
Members: Mozilla, Apple, Opera, Google, Microsoft
Goal: Improve HTML for modern web applications

3️.HTML5 and Beyond
2008: HTML5 – Advanced HTML for better web apps
Supports multimedia, graphics, APIs, responsive design
2016: HTML5.1 – Enhanced HTML5 for all devices, including smart devices, gadgets, and widgets

Define a Tag:
The text placed between left angular brace " < " and right angular brace " > " is called as TAG.

Syntax:	<------>
Example: <html>

Tags are classified into two types:
1. Paired Tags:
The tags that have both opening and closing tags are called as paired tags.

Examples:
	<html>-----------------</html>
	<body>-----------------</body>

Note:The closing tag starts with a forward slash("/")

2. Non-Paired Tags:
The tags that have only opening tags but no closing tags are called as Non-paired tags.
->Unpaired tags are self-closing and do not require a closing tag.

Examples:
<br> or <br/>	<hr> or <hr/>    <img> or <img/>

1. Empty Tags 
-->Empty tags are tags that do not have any content inside them.
-->They are mostly used for formatting or inserting elements in the web page.
Example:- <br>,<hr>

2. Self-Closed Tags
-->Self-closed tags are tags that do not need a separate closing tag because they close themselves.
-->Usually used in XHTML or HTML5 with a slash at the end.
Example:-<img/>,<br/>,<hr/> 

3. Forcefully Closed Tags
-->These are tags that are meant to be paired, but the browser automatically closes them if the closing tag is missing.
-->Often used in older HTML versions or for convenience.
Example: <p>This is a paragraph.  <!-- Closing tag omitted, browser closes it automatically -->

Structure of html:
<html>
       <head>
             <title>---------</title>
       </head>
       <body>
            ----------
            ----------
       </body>
</html>

HTML Elements/Tags
An element consists of three basic parts: 
1. Opening tag
2. Element's content
3. Closing tag.
example: <title>Hello World</title>

Essential HTML Tags
There are four sets of HTML tags that form the basic structure needed for every HTML file:

1 <html></html>
2 <head></head>
3 <title></title>
4 <body></body>

Definition - <html> </html>
This basically defines the document as web page. All other tags must fall between the html tags.

Header - <head> </head>
The header contains information about the document that will not appear on the actual page, such as the title of the document.

Title - <title> </title>
The title tag defines the title that will appear in the title bar of your web browser. The title must appear between the head tags.

Body - <body> </body>
The body tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page. All your images, links and plain text must go between the <body> and </body> tags.

HTML Tags
HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

Syntax:
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

NOTE: The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.

HTML Editors
------------
To create and develop HTML web pages, software editors are used. These editors are mainly grouped into two categories:

1️.Text-based (Code-based) Editors

-->These are basic text editors where you write HTML code manually.
-->Require knowledge of HTML syntax.

Examples :
	Windows: Notepad
	Unix/Linux: VI, ViM
	VI: Visual Editor
	ViM: Visually Improved Editor

Advantages:
	-->Lightweight and simple
	-->Full control over code

Disadvantages:
	-->No visual preview
	-->Requires knowledge of HTML

2️.WYSIWYG Editors (What You See Is What You Get) / IDE

-->These editors allow you to design web pages visually, and the HTML code is generated automatically.
-->Ideal for beginners or designers who prefer drag-and-drop features.

Popular WYSIWYG editors / IDEs:

Macromedia Dreamweaver
Microsoft FrontPage
Adobe Go Live
WebStorm
PyCharm
Sublime Text
Brackets
Edit++, Notepad++
ATOM
Visual Studio Code

Advantages:
	-->Visual design interface
	-->Faster development
	-->Error-free code generation

Disadvantages:
	-->Less control over exact code
	-->Heavy software compared to simple text editors

How to Create a WebPage?
Step1: Launch any Text Editor or IDE 
Step2: Write Required HTML source code 
Step3: Save the file with .htm or .html extension
Step4:Right click on the saved file, open with any Web Browser or Double Click on the saved file.

Example:
<html>
	<head>
		<title>My First Page</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		Welcome to HTML World.!!
	</body>
</html>
