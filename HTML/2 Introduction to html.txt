Define a Tag:
The text placed between left angular brace " < " and right angular brace " > " is called as TAG.

Syntax:	<------>
Example:	<html>

Tags are classified into two types:
1. Paired Tags:
The tags that have both opening and closing tags are called as paired tags.

Examples:
	<html>-----------------</html>
	<body>-----------------</body>

Note:The closing tag starts with a forward slash("/")

2. Non-Paired Tags:
The tags that have only opening tags but no closing tags are called as Non-paired tags.
Examples:
<br> or <br/>	<hr> or <hr/>    <img> or <img/>

1. Empty Tags 2. Self-Closed Tags 3. Forcefully Closed Tags

Structure of html:
<html>
       <head>
             <title>---------</title>
       </head>
       <body>
            ----------
            ----------
       </body>
</html>

HTML Elements/Tags
An element consists of three basic parts: 
1. Opening tag
2. Element's content
3. Closing tag.
example: <title>Hello World</title>

Essential HTML Tags
There are four sets of HTML tags that form the basic structure needed for every HTML file:

1 <html></html>
2 <head></head>
3 <title></title>
4 <body></body>

Definition - <html> </html>
This basically defines the document as web page. All other tags must fall between the html tags.

Header - <head> </head>
The header contains information about the document that will not appear on the actual page, such as the title of the document.

Title - <title> </title>
The title tag defines the title that will appear in the title bar of your web browser. The title must appear between the head tags.

Body - <body> </body>
The body tags contain all the information and other visible content on the page. All your images, links and plain text must go between the <body> and </body> tags.

HTML Tags
HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

Syntax:
<tagname>content goes here...</tagname>

NOTE: The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
