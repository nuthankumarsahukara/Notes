Packages in PL/SQL
PL/SQL package is a logical grouping of a related subprogram (procedure/function) into a single element. A Package is compiled and stored as a database object that can be used later.

Components of Packages:-

PL/SQL package has two components.
1.Package Specification
2.Package Body

Package Specification
Package specification consists of a declaration of all the public variables, cursors, objects, procedures, functions,and exception.

Package Body
It consists of the definition of all the elements that are present in the package specification. It can also have a definition of elements that are not declared in the specification, these elements are called private elements and can be called only from inside the package.
 
Benefits of using Package
Following are some of the benefits of packages in PL/SQL:
1.REUSABILITY Whenever a package is created, it is compiled and stored in the database. So, you write the code once which can be reused by other applications.

2.OVERLOADING Two or more >procedures or functions can be created in a package with the same name. 

3.CREATING MODULES A large application can be created by simply creating modules (or subprograms) clearly defined and easy to work.

4.IMPROVES PERFORMANCE Package code gets loaded inside the SGA(system global area) of Oracle at first call itself due to which other subsequent calls will work very fast.

5.GLOBAL DECLARATION If the objects(procedures, functions, variables, constants, exceptions, cursor etc) are declared globally in a package, they can be easily used when required.

Package specification or declaration Syntax

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE <package_name> IS/AS 
FUNCTION <function_name> (<list of arguments>) 
RETURN <datatype>;
PROCEDURE <procedure_name> (<list of arguments>); 
- code statements
END <package_name>;

Example:- create or replace package pack_calc is 
 	function add(a number,b number) return number ;
	function sub(a number,b number) return number ;
	function mul(a number,b number) return number ;
	function div(a number,b number) return number ;
	end pack_calc;

Package Body Syntax:-

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY <package_name> IS/AS
FUNCTION <function_name> (<list of arguments>) RETURN <datatype>IS/AS 
- local variable declaration;
BEGIN
	- executable statements;
EXCEPTION
	- error handling statements;
END <function_name>;

PROCEDURE <procedure_name> (<list of arguments>)IS/AS 
- local variable declaration;
BEGIN
	- executable statements;
EXCEPTION
	- error handling statements;
END <procedure_name>;
	
END <package_name>;

Example:-	create or replace package body pack_calc is
	function add(a number, b number) return number is
	begin
	return a+b;
	end;

	function sub(a number, b number) return number is
	begin
	return a-b;
	end;

	function mul(a number, b number) return number is
	begin
	return a*b;
	end;

	function div(a number, b number) return number is
	begin
	return a/b;
	end;
	
	end pack_calc;

Syntax for referring a package object:
Packagename.objectname;

Example:
	declare 
	x number;
	y number;
	begin
	x:=&x;
	y:=&y;
	
	dbms_output.put_line('The Addition is '||pack_calc.add(x,y));
	dbms_output.put_line('The Substraction is '||pack_calc.sub(x,y));
	dbms_output.put_line('The Multiplication is '||pack_calc.mul(x,y));
	dbms_output.put_line('The Division is '||pack_calc.div(x,y));	

	end;

With Table Package Example:

create the package declaration:
	
create or replace package pkg_emp is
 procedure updateRecord(eno employee.empno%type);
 function deleteRecord(enm employee.ename%type);
 return boolean;
end pkg_emp;

create the package body:
 create or replace package body pkg_emp is 
 procedure updateRecord(eno employee.empno%type) is
 begin
 update employee set comm=100 where empno=eno;
 if sql%found then
	dbms_output.put_line('Record Updated');
 else
	dbms_output.put_line('Record Not Updated');
 end if;
 end updateRecord;

 function deleteRecord(enm employee.ename%type) return boolean is
 begin
 delete from employee where ename=enm;
 return sql%found;
 end deleteRecord;

end pkg_emp;
	
calling the Package:

declare 
	eno employee.empno%type;
	e_comm employee.comm%type;
	enm employee.ename%type;
begin
	eno:=&eno;
	enm:='&enm';
	pkg_emp.updateRecord(eno);
	if pkg_emp.deleteRecord(enm) then
		dbms_output.put_line('Record Deleted');
	else
		dbms_output.put_line('Record Not Deleted');
	end if;
end;
