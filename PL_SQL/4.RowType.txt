Table Data Accessing in PL/SQL

SELECT INTO statement is the simplest and fastest way to fetch a single row from a table into variables. 
Syntax:
 select list INTO variable_list FROM table_name WHERE condition;

Variable Attributes in PL/SQL.

%TYPE:-
The %TYPE attribute is used to declare variables according to the already declared variable or database column. It is used when you are declaring an individual variable, not a record. The data type and precision of the variable declared using %TYPE attribute is the same as that of the column that is referred from a given table.

Syntax: <var_name> <tab_name>.<column_name>%TYPE;

Example:-
declare
eno employee.empno%type;
enm employee.ename%type;
jb employee.job%type;
begin
eno:=&eno;
select ename,job into enm,jb from employee where empno=eno;
dbms_output.put_line(enm || 'is working as ' || jb);
end;

%ROWTYPE:-
The %ROWTYPE attribute is used to declare a record type that represents a row in a table. The record can store an entire row or some specific data selected from the table. A column in a row and corresponding fields in a record have the same name and data types.
Syntax <var_name> <tab_name>%ROWTYPE;

Example 1:
	
declare
eno employee.empno%type;
emp employee%rowtype;

begin
eno:=&eno;
select ename,job,sal into emp.ename,emp.job,emp.sal from employee where empno=eno;
dbms_output.put_line(emp.ename || 'is working as ' || emp.job ||' earning sal ' ||to_char(emp.sal));
end;

Example 2:
	
declare
eno employee.empno%type;
emp employee%rowtype;

begin
eno:=&eno;
select ename,job,comm into emp.ename,emp.job,emp.comm from employee where empno=eno;
if emp.comm is null then
update employee set comm=100 where empno=eno;
dbms_output.put_line(emp.ename || 'is working as ' || emp.job ||' his commission updated');
else 
dbms_output.put_line('No Update');
end if; 
end;
